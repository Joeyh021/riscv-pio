# RISC-V PIO

This is my third year project, programmable state-machine based I/O blocks, designed for use in low-power RISC-V SoCs.

## Usage

- `sbt run` generates the verilog, which can then be synthesised or simulated however you please
- `sbt test` runs the testbenches, verifying things work as intended
